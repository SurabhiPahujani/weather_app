#  Weather App
A simple application to display  weather app using the OpenWeatherMap API. Built on top of my recently created [React-Redux-Sass Starter Kit](https://github.com/Gigacore/React-Redux-Sass-Starter).


## Pre-requisites
* Node.js 9.8.0 and above

## Run
```
git clone
cd weather_app
npm i
```


## Start the dev server
```

npm run start:dev

```

## Build
```

npm run build

```

#### Notes:
* Running the build bundles all your updates to ```bundle.js``` and ```bundle.css``` in dist folder.
* If you insist to automate the build upon appending changes to files, use ```webpack --watch```

- [ ] Prevent fetching new data on every refresh by caching the data for a set duration of session.

### Tech Stack

* React.js
* Redux
* JavaScript (ES6)
* HTML5
* SASS
